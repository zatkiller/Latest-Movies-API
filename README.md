Initially the Latest Movies application started off as a frontend only application which uses [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to get the latest and trending movies. However, I realized that the data retrieval was quite slow, so I decided to build my own API and speed up the data retrieval with caching. Redis is the choice of cache for the server.

Technologies used:
- NodeJS
- Express
- Redis
